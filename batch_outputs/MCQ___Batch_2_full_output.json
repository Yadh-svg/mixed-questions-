          "key_idea": "This problem uses the 'short form' of the sum formula, which relies on knowing the start and end of the sequence. By adding the first and last terms, you find the sum of a representative 'pair'. Step 1: Identify the bounds ($a_1, a_n$) and the count ($n$). Step 2: Sum the bounds. Step 3: Multiply by $\\frac{n}{2}$. This logic is based on the fact that terms equidistant from the ends have the same sum. A common mistake is using the wrong $n$. Tip: Always verify the number of rows/terms."
