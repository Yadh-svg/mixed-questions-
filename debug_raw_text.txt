      "scenario_text": "In a small town in Karnataka, the local municipal corporation is installing new LED streetlights along a straight main road to improve safety. The workers start placing the poles from one end of the road, ensuring there is a fixed distance between every two consecutive poles to provide uniform illumination for the residents at night. As the project progresses, each pole is assigned a unique identification number based on its position relative to the starting point of the road. This systematic arrangement helps the maintenance crew locate specific poles easily during repairs.",
      "diagram_description": "A schematic diagram showing a straight road starting from an entrance arch. The first pole, labeled 'Pole 1', is positioned at a distance of 7 m from the arch. The second pole, labeled 'Pole 2', is positioned at a distance of 12 m from the arch. The diagram shows a series of dots representing subsequent poles, with a note indicating that the interval between any two consecutive poles remains constant throughout the installation.",

        "Topic Used: Arithmetic Progression (nth Term)\nMarks: 1.0 | DOK: 1\nBased on the initial layout, calculate the distance of the 15th pole from the starting arch.",
        "Topic Used: Arithmetic Progression (nth Term)\nMarks: 1.0 | DOK: 1\nA supervisor records that the 5th pole is at a distance of 27 m and the 10th pole is at a distance of 52 m; identify the constant common difference in distance between any two consecutive poles.",
        "Topic Used: Arithmetic Progression (nth Term)\nMarks: 1.0 | DOK: 1\nA worker finds a maintenance marker placed at a distance of 105 m from the arch; determine if this marker coincides exactly with the position of one of the numbered poles."

      "solution": "1. **Find distance of 15th pole:**\n- Identify first term (a) = 7 and common difference (d) = 12 - 7 = 5. [0.5 marks]\n- Use formula $a_n = a + (n-1)d$: $a_{15} = 7 + (15-1)5 = 7 + 70 = 77$ m. [0.5 marks]\n\n2. **Find common difference (d):**\n- Given $a_5 = 27$ and $a_{10} = 52$. [0.25 marks]\n- $a + 4d = 27$ and $a + 9d = 52$. [0.25 marks]\n- Subtracting equations: $(a + 9d) - (a + 4d) = 52 - 27 \Rightarrow 5d = 25$. [0.25 marks]\n- $d = 5$ m. [0.25 marks]\n\n3. **Determine if 105 belongs to the sequence:**\n- Set $a_n = 105$: $7 + (n-1)5 = 105$. [0.25 marks]\n- $(n-1)5 = 98$. [0.25 marks]\n- $n-1 = 19.6 \Rightarrow n = 20.6$. [0.25 marks]\n- Since $n$ is not a natural number, the marker does not coincide with a pole. [0.25 marks]",
      "key_idea": "1. **What kind of problems these are:** These problems involve finding specific values or positions in a list of numbers that change by the same amount every time.\n2. **Core idea:** An Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence where the difference between any two consecutive terms is a constant called the 'common difference'.\n3. **Why this idea works:** Because the change is constant, we can reach any position 'n' by starting at the first term and adding the common difference 'n-1' times.\n4. **General step-by-step method:**\nStep 1: Identify the first term (a) and common difference (d) from the given data.\nStep 2: Use the formula $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ to find a specific term.\nStep 3: To find 'd' from two terms, set up linear equations and subtract them.\nStep 4: To check if a value belongs, solve for 'n' and verify if it is a whole positive number.\n5. **Common mistakes:** Students often use 'n' instead of 'n-1' in the formula, or they incorrectly calculate the difference by subtracting in the wrong order.\n6. **Tips:** Always double-check if 'n' is an integer when verifying if a number belongs to a sequence."

      "scenario_text": "Ramesh, a fruit vendor in a busy Nagpur market, stacks fresh oranges in a specific triangular arrangement to attract customers. He places a small number of oranges in the topmost row and increases the count of oranges in each subsequent row below it by a fixed amount to maintain a stable and aesthetically pleasing structure. This organized display not only draws attention but also allows Ramesh to estimate his total inventory by counting the number of rows instead of every single fruit.",

      "solution": "1. **Sum of first 12 terms:**\n- From diagram: $a = 5$, $d = 8 - 5 = 3$, $n = 12$. [0.25 marks]\n- Formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$.

      "key_idea": "1. **What kind of problems these are:** These problems involve finding the total sum of all numbers in an ordered list where each number increases or decreases by the same amount.\n2. **Core idea:** The sum of an AP is the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms.\n3. **Why this idea works:** If you pair the first term with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on, each pair adds up to the same value.\n4. **General step-by-step method:**\nStep 1: Identify 'a' (first term), 'd' (difference), and 'n' (number of terms).\nStep 2: If the last term is known, use $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$.\nStep 3: If only 'd' is known, use $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$.\nStep 4: If finding 'n', substitute values and solve the resulting quadratic equation.\n5. **Common mistakes:** Forgetting to divide by 2 in the sum formula or miscalculating the '2a' part of the long formula.\n6. **Tips:** When solving for 'n', if you get two values from a quadratic equation, ignore the negative or fractional value as 'n' must be a positive integer."
