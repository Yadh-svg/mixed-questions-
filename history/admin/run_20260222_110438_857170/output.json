What kind of problems these are: These problems focus on finding the total accumulated value of a sequence (sum) rather than a single term.\\n2. Core idea: The sum of an AP is the result of adding all terms from the first to the nth term.\\n3. Why this idea works: Because the terms increase/decrease at a constant rate, the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms gives the total sum.\\n4. General step-by-step method:\\n   Step 1: Identify $a, d, n$, and the last term $l$ if available.\\n   Step 2: Choose the formula: $S_n = \\\\frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$ if $d$ is known, or $S_n = \\\\frac{n}{2}[a + l]$ if the last term is known.\\n   Step 3: Substitute the known values.\\n   Step 4: Calculate the final sum or the missing parameter.\\n5. Common mistakes: Forgetting to divide by 2 in the formula or confusing the nth term ($a_n$) with the sum ($S_n$).\\n6. Tips: If you have both the first and last terms, always use the shorter formula ($a + l$) to save time and reduce calculation errors.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
