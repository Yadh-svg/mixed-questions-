            "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems involve finding a missing component (first term, common difference, or position) in a linear sequence where values change by a fixed amount.\n2. Core idea: The relationship between any term and its position is governed by the Arithmetic Progression formula: $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\n3. Why this idea works: Since the difference is constant, to reach the $n^{th}$ term, you start at the first term and add the common difference $(n-1)$ times.\n4. General method:\nStep 1: Identify the known values ($a$, $d$, $n$, or $a_n$).\nStep 2: Substitute these into the formula $a_n = a + (n-1)d$.\nStep 3: Solve the resulting linear equation for the unknown variable.\nStep 4: Label the final answer with appropriate units.\n5. Common mistakes: Students often use $n$ instead of $(n-1)$ in the formula, or perform incorrect algebraic transposition when solving for $d$ or $a$.\n6. Tips: Always write down the known values with their symbols before starting the calculation to avoid confusion."

Due to the angle of the roof, the amount of water collected in each bin increases by a fixed volume as she moves down the row. Kavita needs to calculate the total water collected across various sections of the row to present a report to the village committee. She tracks the volume in the first bin and the constant increase per bin to manage the total data effectively.",

The volume increases by a constant 1.5 liters ($d$) for each subsequent bin. For the first sub-question, the 10th bin is noted to contain 15.5 liters.

            "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems involve calculating the total accumulation of values in an arithmetic sequence.\n2. Core idea: The sum of an AP ($S_n$) can be found using the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms.\n3. Why this idea works: In an AP, pairs of terms (first + last, second + second last) always sum to the same constant value.\n4. General method:\nStep 1: If the last term is known, use $S_n = (n/2)(a + l)$.\nStep 2: If the last term is unknown, use $S_n = (n/2)[2a + (n-1)d]$.\nStep 3: To find the sum of a range from term $m$ to $n$, calculate $S_n$ and subtract $S_{m-1}$.\n5. Common mistakes: Forgetting to multiply by $n/2$ or using the wrong 'n' when calculating the sum of a range (e.g., subtracting $S_m$ instead of $S_{m-1}$).\n6. Tips: Always check if you have the last term value before deciding which formula version to use to save time."
