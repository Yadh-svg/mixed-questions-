            "solution": "Sub-question 1:\n1. Identify n = 10, a = 5, and l = 50. [0.25 Mark]\n2. Use the sum formula: Sₙ = (n/2)(a + l). [0.25 Mark]\n3. Substitute values: S₁₀ = (10/2)(5 + 50).\n4. Calculate: S₁₀ = 5 × 55 = 275. [0.5 Mark]\nFinal Answer: ₹275.\n\nSub-question 2:\n1. Identify a = 10, d = 5, and n = 6. [0.25 Mark]\n2. Use the sum formula: Sₙ = (n/2)[2a + (n - 1)d]. [0.25 Mark]\n3. Substitute values: S₆ = (6/2)[2(10) + (6 - 1)5].\n4. Calculate: S₆ = 3[20 + 25] = 3 × 45 = 135. [0.5 Mark]\nFinal Answer: ₹135.\n\nSub-question 3:\n1. Identify a = 2, d = 2, and Sₙ = 30. [0.25 Mark]\n2. Use formula: 30 = (n/2)[2(2) + (n - 1)2]. [0.25 Mark]\n3. Simplify: 30 = (n/2)[4 + 2n - 2] => 30 = (n/2)[2n + 2] => 30 = n(n + 1). [0.25 Mark]\n4. Solve for n: Since 5 × 6 = 30, n = 5. [0.25 Mark]\nFinal Answer: 5 days.",
            "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems involve finding the grand total of a series of numbers that follow a predictable pattern.\n2. Core idea: Instead of adding every number one by one, we can find the average of the first and last numbers and multiply by the count of numbers.\n3. Why this idea works: In a constant pattern, the sum of the first and last terms is the same as the sum of the second and second-to-last terms, allowing us to form equal pairs.\n4. General step-by-step method:\nStep 1: Find the first and last values (if possible).\nStep 2: Determine how many values there are in total.\nStep 3: Apply the sum formula.\nStep 4: Check if the total makes sense compared to the individual values.\n5. Common mistakes: Dividing the wrong number by 2 or forgetting to multiply the first term by 2 in the long formula.\n6. Tips: If you know the last term, always use the shorter formula (a+l) to save time."
