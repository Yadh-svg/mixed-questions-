            "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems involve finding specific values in a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.\n2. Core idea: An Arithmetic Progression (AP) is defined by its starting value ($a$) and the constant amount added to each term ($d$).\n3. Why this idea works: The formula $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ works because to reach the $n^{th}$ position, you start at the first and add the difference $(n-1)$ times.\n4. General step-by-step method:\nStep 1: Identify the first term ($a$) and the common difference ($d$).\nStep 2: Identify the position ($n$) or the value of the term ($a_n$) needed.\nStep 3: Substitute known values into the general term formula.\nStep 4: Solve for the unknown variable.\n5. Common mistakes: Students often use $n$ instead of $(n-1)$ or make calculation errors with algebraic variables.\n6. Tips: Always double-check if 'n' represents the correct position number and write down the given values clearly before substituting."

[0.25 mark]\n- $S_{10} = 5[30 + 45] = 5[75]$. [0.25 mark]\n- Final Answer: 375 books. [0.25 mark]\n\nSub-question 2:\n- Identify $a = 12$, $l = 60$, $n = 12$. [0.25 mark]\n- Use $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$: $S_{12} = \\frac{12}{2}(12 + 60)$. [0.25 mark]\n- $S_{12} = 6(72)$. [0.25 mark]\n- Final Answer: 432 books. [0.25 mark]\n\nSub-question 3:\n- Identify $a = 10$, $d = 2$, $S_n = 190$. [0.25 mark]\n- $190 = \\frac{n}{2}[2(10) + (n - 1)2] \\Rightarrow 190 = n[10 + n - 1]$. [0.25 mark]\n- $190 = n^2 + 9n \\Rightarrow n^2 + 9n - 190 = 0$. [0.25 mark]\n- Factors are $(n + 19)(n - 10) = 0$; since $n > 0$, $n = 10$. Final Answer: 10 floors. [0.25 mark]",
            "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems find the total accumulation of values across a sequence where each step increases or decreases by a fixed amount.\n2. Core idea: The sum of an AP ($S_n$) can be calculated using the average of the first and last terms multiplied by the number of terms.\n3. Why this idea works: By pairing the first and last terms, second and second-to-last, etc., we find each pair has the same sum, allowing for a simplified total.\n4. General step-by-step method:\nStep 1: Identify the values for $a$ (first term) and $d$ (common difference) or $l$ (last term).\nStep 2: Determine $n$ (total terms).\nStep 3: Choose the correct sum formula based on given data ($S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$ or $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[a+l]$).\nStep 4: Solve for the unknown value.\n5. Common mistakes: Confusing the $n^{th}$ term ($a_n$) with the sum ($S_n$) or making errors in solving quadratic equations for $n$.\n6.
