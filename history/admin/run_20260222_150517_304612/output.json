Why this idea works: Since the change is constant, any term can be calculated by adding the common difference to the first term a specific number of times ($n-1$ times for the $n^{th}$ term).\n4. Step-by-step method:\n   Step 1: Identify the first term ($a$) and the common difference ($d$).\n   Step 2: Determine what needs to be found ($a_n, d, or n$).\n   Step 3: Substitute the known values into the formula $a_n = a + (n - 1)d$.\n   Step 4: Solve the equation for the unknown variable.\n5. Common mistakes: Students often use $n$ instead of $n-1$ in the formula or calculate the common difference by subtracting the first term from the second in the wrong order.\n6. Tips: Always double-check if the sequence is increasing (positive $d$) or decreasing (negative $d$) before substituting."

To keep the stacks stable against the wind, they followed a specific method where each layer of the stack had fewer bundles than the one below it. This created a sturdy, tapering shape that looked like a stepped pyramid. Arjun noticed that the decrease in the number of bundles was the same for every layer, making the structure look very symmetrical and organized as it reached the top.",

This pattern of decreasing by one bundle per layer continues. A separate stack is also shown where the first layer has 20 bundles and the total number of bundles in the entire stack is 155.",

            "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems require finding the total sum of all values in an arithmetic sequence.\n2. Core idea: The sum of an AP can be found by pairing the terms from the start and end, as each pair has the same sum.\n3. Why this idea works: The formula $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a + l)$ works because it represents the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms.\n4. Step-by-step method:\n   Step 1: List the knowns: first term ($a$), last term ($l$), common difference ($d$), or number of terms ($n$).\n   Step 2: Choose the appropriate formula based on whether the last term is known ($S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a+l)$ or $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$).\n   Step 3: Substitute the values and simplify.\n   Step 4: For finding $n$, solve the resulting linear or quadratic equation.\n5. Common mistakes: Forgetting to divide by 2 or using the wrong sign for the common difference ($d$) in decreasing sequences.\n6. Tips: If solving for $n$ results in two positive integers, check which one is physically possible in the context of the story."
