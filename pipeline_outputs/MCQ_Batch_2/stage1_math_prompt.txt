    The user needs the following specific questions designed:
    
    <source_material>
      <new_concept>
        
      </new_concept>
      
      <old_concept>
        
      </old_concept>
      
      <files_uploaded>
        None
      </files_uploaded>
      
      <file_instruction>
        - If files are uploaded, use them as the PRIMARY source for specific question details as indicated in requirements.
        - 'New Concept' text above is the theoretical basis.
        - 'Old Concept' is prerequisite knowledge.
      </file_instruction>
    </source_material>
    
    <already_seen_topics>
- Arithmetic Progression: Defining sequences by a constant difference and determining specific terms using the formula $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$.
    </already_seen_topics>
    <core_skill_instruction>
      You MUST AVOID using the exact topics listed above if possible. 
      - If a topic is repeated, find a DISTINCT sub-topic or different mathematical angle.
      - Ensure diversity across batches.
    </core_skill_instruction>

  <task>  
    You are the **"Architect"**. Your role is to design the **Math Core** for the requested questions.

    STRICT RULES:  
    - Do NOT write a story.  
    - Do NOT write a scenario.  
    - Do NOT restate or display DOK level, marks, or any metadata provided in the input.  
    - ONLY design the mathematical structure and logic that will generate the question.  
    - If **Additional Notes** are provided, they are mandatory design constraints and must be applied.

    For EACH question listed in <design_requirements>, define:

    1. **Abstract Math Structure**  
      - The underlying mathematical framework (e.g., Right Triangle, Linear Pair, Quadratic Curve, etc.)  
      - Must be deep enough to support the required reasoning complexity.

    2. **Topic Identification and Description**  
      - Identify the specific mathematical topic being used.  
      - Provide a brief description of the topic, including the main concepts or component ideas within it.

    3. **Subtopic Differentiation (ONLY if multiple questions share the same topic)**  
      - Identify a distinct subtopic for each question.  
      - Subtopics must be unique across questions.  
      - Subtopics must come from conceptual analysis (textbook structure, concept hierarchy, or progression of ideas).

  </task>

  <requirements>

    1. TOPIC ANALYSIS  
      - For each given topic, describe the conceptual coverage (what ideas, properties, or methods belong to it).  
      - If multiple questions use the same topic, assign different subtopics within that topic.

    2. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY  
      - The math structure must be sufficiently rich to support the required reasoning level.  
      - The structure must naturally produce the intended mathematical task.

    3. ADDITIONAL NOTES (MANDATORY)  
      - Any condition, restriction, or design instruction provided must be incorporated into the structure.

    4. OUTPUT RESTRICTIONS  
      - Do NOT include DOK level, marks, scoring, pedagogy labels, or curriculum references.  
      - Only output structural mathematical design.
