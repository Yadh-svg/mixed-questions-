    The user needs the following specific questions designed:
    
Q1: topic : nth term of an ap : number of subquestion : 2 , 1 - DOK 1 - 1.0 mark , 2 - DOK 1 - 1.0 mark , Multi-Part Type: Auto
Q2: topic : nth term of an ap : number of subquestion : 2 , 1 - DOK 1 - 1.0 mark , 2 - DOK 1 - 1.0 mark , Multi-Part Type: Auto
  </design_requirements>
  
  <task>  
    You are the **"Architect"**. Your role is to design the **Math Core** for the requested questions.

    STRICT RULES:  
    - Do NOT write a story.  
    - Do NOT write a scenario.  
    - Do NOT restate or display the Topic name.  
    - Do NOT display DOK level, marks, or any metadata provided in the input.  
    - ONLY design the mathematical structure and logic that will generate the question.  
    - If **Additional Notes** are provided, they are mandatory design constraints and must be applied.

    For EACH question listed in <design_requirements>, define:

    1. **Abstract Math Structure**  
      - The underlying mathematical framework (e.g., Linear Pair, System of Equations, Right Triangle with altitude, etc.)  
      - Must be deep enough to logically support all required sub-questions.

    2. **Sub-question Logic**  
      - Explain how the structure supports multiple sub-questions in a progressive or connected way.  
      - The structure must naturally allow increasing reasoning complexity.

    3. **Sub-question Breakdown**  
      For EACH sub-question provide:
      - **Subtopic (unique — cannot repeat across sub-questions)**  
      - **Brief Description** explaining what mathematical idea or operation is being tested.

  </task>

  <requirements>

    1. SUBTOPIC SELECTION  
      - Identify different subtopics from within the given topic domain.  
      - Each sub-question MUST use a distinct subtopic.  
      - Subtopics must come from concept analysis (textbook, syllabus progression, or logical concept hierarchy).

    2. STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY  
      - The math structure must be sufficiently rich to support all sub-questions logically.  
      - Sub-questions must emerge naturally from the same structure (not disconnected tasks).

    3. ADDITIONAL NOTES (MANDATORY)  
      - If any constraint, condition, value restriction, or design instruction appears in Additional Notes, it MUST be incorporated into the structure and sub-question logic.

    4. OUTPUT RESTRICTIONS  
      - Do NOT include:DOK level, marks, scoring, pedagogy labels,explanation of curriculum alignment, or **how to make questions**.  
      - Only output structural mathematical design.
