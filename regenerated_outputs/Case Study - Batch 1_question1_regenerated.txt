  "scenario_text": "Yadhu is helping his grandfather organize a plantation drive in their village garden. They decide to plant saplings in a perfectly straight line, ensuring there is a fixed, equal gap between every consecutive sapling to allow enough room for the roots to spread. Yadhu uses a long measuring tape starting from the very first sapling to mark the exact spots where the subsequent saplings should be placed. As the row grows longer, he notices that the distance from the starting point to each new sapling follows a steady increasing pattern.",
  "diagram_description": "The diagram shows a garden row starting at a wooden stake labeled as the first position. A measuring tape lies along the ground. The first sapling is at the 2-meter mark on the tape. The 10th sapling is shown further down the row, positioned exactly at the 20-meter mark on the same tape.",
  "questions_list": [
    "If the first sapling is at 2 meters and the 10th sapling is at 20 meters, what is the fixed distance between each consecutive sapling?",
    "If the first sapling is at 2 meters and the fixed distance between each sapling is 2 meters, at which sapling number (position) would Yadhu be if the tape measure reads 30 meters?",
    "If the first sapling is at 2 meters and the gap between each sapling is 2 meters, what distance will the measuring tape show for the 15th sapling?"

  "solution": "Sub-question 1:\n1. Identify the first term (a) = 2 and the 10th term (a\u2081\u2080) = 20. [0.25 Mark]\n2. Use the formula for the nth term: a\u2099 = a + (n - 1)d. [0.25 Mark]\n3. Substitute the values: 20 = 2 + (10 - 1)d.\n4. Solve for d: 18 = 9d => d = 2. [0.5 Mark]\nFinal Answer: 2 meters.\n\nSub-question 2:\n1. Identify a = 2, d = 2, and a\u2099 = 30. [0.25 Mark]\n2. Use the formula: 30 = 2 + (n - 1)2. [0.25 Mark]\n3. Subtract 2 from both sides: 28 = (n - 1)2.\n4. Divide by 2: 14 = n - 1 => n = 15. [0.5 Mark]\nFinal Answer: 15th sapling.\n\nSub-question 3:\n1. Identify a = 2, d = 2, and n = 15. [0.25 Mark]\n2. Use the formula: a\u2081\u2085 = 2 + (15 - 1)2. [0.25 Mark]\n3. Calculate the bracket: a\u2081\u2085 = 2 + (14 \u00d7 2).\n4. Final calculation: a\u2081\u2085 = 2 + 28 = 30. [0.5 Mark]\nFinal Answer: 30 meters.",
  "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems involve finding specific values in a list of numbers that increase or decrease by the same amount every time.\n2. Core idea: The main idea is that every 'step' in the sequence is the same size, which we call the common difference.\n3. Why this idea works: Because the change is constant, we can multiply the size of one step by the number of steps taken to find any position.\n4. General step-by-step method:\nStep 1: Identify the starting number (a).\nStep 2: Identify the size of the jump (d).\nStep 3: Identify which position you are looking for (n).\nStep 4: Use the pattern rule to calculate the missing piece.\n5. Common mistakes: Students often use 'n' instead of 'n-1' (forgetting the first term doesn't have a jump before it) or perform addition before multiplication.\n6. Tips: Always check if the first term is included in your count of jumps."
