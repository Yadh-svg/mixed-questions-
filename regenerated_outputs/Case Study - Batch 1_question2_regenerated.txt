  "scenario_text": "During the Diwali festival, Meera and her neighbors decide to decorate the main street of their colony with strings of LED lights arranged on triangular frames. These frames are placed in a long row along the sidewalk. To create a beautiful cascading effect, each successive frame is designed to hold more bulbs than the one before it. Meera needs to calculate the total number of bulbs required for different sections of the street to ensure they purchase the correct quantity from the local electrical market.",
  "diagram_description": "The diagram depicts a sequence of three triangular frames used for lighting. Frame 1 is labeled with '12 bulbs'. Frame 2 is labeled with '15 bulbs'. Frame 3 is labeled with '18 bulbs'. An arrow indicates that the number of bulbs continues to increase by the same amount for all subsequent frames in the row.",
  "questions_list": [
    "If Meera sets up a total of 50 frames in the first section of the street, what is the total number of bulbs required for this section?",
    "In a separate smaller section, the first frame has 12 bulbs and the very last frame has 60 bulbs. If there are exactly 17 frames in this section, calculate the total number of bulbs used here.",
    "For the original row of 60 frames, Meera wants to know the total number of bulbs used specifically from the 11th frame to the 50th frame inclusive. What is this total?"

  "solution": "From the diagram, first term (a) = 12, common difference (d) = 15 - 12 = 3.\n\nSub-question 1:\nUsing the sum formula: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$\nFor $n = 50$:\n$S_{50} = \\frac{50}{2}[2(12) + (50-1)3]$ [0.5 marks]\n$S_{50} = 25[24 + 49 \\times 3] = 25[24 + 147] = 25[171] = 4275$\nAnswer: 4275 bulbs. [0.5 marks]\n\nSub-question 2:\nUsing the formula with last term: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[a + l]$\nGiven $a = 12$, $l = 60$, $n = 17$.\n$S_{17} = \\frac{17}{2}[12 + 60]$ [0.5 marks]\n$S_{17} = \\frac{17}{2}[72] = 17 \\times 36 = 612$\nAnswer: 612 bulbs. [0.5 marks]\n\nSub-question 3:\nSum from 11th to 50th term = $S_{50} - S_{10}$.\nWe already have $S_{50} = 4275$ from calculation in sub-question 1.\n$S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2}[2(12) + (10-1)3] = 5[24 + 27] = 5[51] = 255$ [0.5 marks]\nSum (11 to 50) = $4275 - 255 = 4020$\nAnswer: 4020 bulbs. [0.5 marks]",
  "key_idea": "1. What kind of problems these are: These problems involve finding the total accumulation of values in a sequence that follows a constant rate of change.\n2. Core idea: The sum of an AP is based on the fact that the sum of the first and last terms is the same as the sum of the second and second-to-last terms, and so on.\n3. Why this idea works: Because the increase is constant, the average value of all terms is exactly the midpoint between the first and last terms. Multiplying this average by the number of terms gives the total sum.\n4. General method:\nStep 1: Identify 'a', 'd', and the number of terms 'n'.\nStep 2: Use $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$ for direct calculation.\nStep 3: Use $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}[a + l]$ if the last term is known.\nStep 4: For an intermediate segment, subtract the sum of the excluded leading terms from the total sum.\n5. Common mistakes: Forgetting to divide by 2 or using 'n' as the last term instead of the number of terms. \n6. Tips: To find the sum of terms from 'm' to 'n', always calculate $S_n - S_{m-1}$ to ensure the m-th term is included in the result."
