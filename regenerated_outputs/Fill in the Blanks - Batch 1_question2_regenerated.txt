  "question_text": "Topic Used: Arithmetic Progression\n\nScenario: A scholarship fund is established with an initial deposit, and subsequent annual additions are planned to increase by a fixed amount.\n\nQuestion: In a fund where the initial deposit is $a = 1000$ and the common difference for subsequent additions is $d = 50$, the total sum of the fund after the $1^{st}$ deposit ($n = 1$) is |TEXT 1|.",
  "correct_answer": "TEXT 1: 1000",
  "solution": "1. Identify the components: The first term ($a$) is 1000 and the common difference ($d$) is 50.\n2. The question asks for the sum of the first $n$ terms where $n = 1$.\n3. Use the definition of the sum of an arithmetic progression: The sum of the first term ($S_1$) is always equal to the first term ($a$) itself.\n4. Thus, $S_1 = 1000$.\n\nMarking Scheme:\n- Correct identification that the sum of the first term equals the first term: 1.0 Mark",
  "key_idea": "1. These problems require finding the total accumulated value of a sequence up to a certain point.\n2. The core idea is that the sum of an Arithmetic Progression ($S_n$) combines all terms from the first to the $n^{th}$ position.\n3. This works because the formula accounts for the average value of the terms multiplied by the number of terms.\n4. To solve this:\n   - Step 1: Identify the first term ($a$).\n   - Step 2: Identify the common difference ($d$).\n   - Step 3: Identify the number of terms to be added ($n$).\n   - Step 4: Apply the principle that for the very first step ($n=1$), no addition has occurred yet, so the sum equals the start.\n5. Common mistakes: Trying to apply the full sum formula and making calculation errors when $n=1$; confusing the common difference with the total sum.\n6. Tip: Always remember that the sum of the first term ($S_1$) and the value of the first term ($a_1$) are identical."
