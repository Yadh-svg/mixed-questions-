  "scenario_text": "Yadhu is organizing a collection of traditional brass pots in a decorative display for a cultural event. He decides to arrange them in a series of horizontal tiers where each tier below the top one contains a consistently higher number of pots than the one immediately above it. This stacking method ensures a stable and visually appealing structure for the exhibition, requiring a precise count of items to ensure the display area is adequately filled from top to bottom.",
  "diagram_description": "The diagram illustrates a tiered shelf with 8 distinct horizontal levels. The first level at the top is marked with a quantity of 10 brass pots. Every subsequent level below it contains 2 additional pots compared to the level directly above it. The total number of levels in the arrangement is 8.",
  "questions_list": [
    "Topic Used: SUM OF N TERMS\nMetadata: Mark: 1.0 | DOK: 1\nBased on the arrangement, identify the numerical value of the first term (a) and the common difference (d) for the sequence of pots.",
    "Topic Used: SUM OF N TERMS\nMetadata: Mark: 1.0 | DOK: 1\nDetermine the total number of terms (n) representing the complete set of tiers in Yadhu's decorative structure.",
    "Topic Used: SUM OF N TERMS\nMetadata: Mark: 1.0 | DOK: 1\nIdentify the correct mathematical formula for the sum of the first n terms (S\u2099) of an arithmetic progression that calculates the total pots.",
    "Topic Used: SUM OF N TERMS\nMetadata: Mark: 1.0 | DOK: 1\nCalculate the total quantity of brass pots Yadhu needs to complete the entire 8-tier display."

  "solution": "1. Identification of parameters:\n- First term (a) = 10 [0.5 Mark]\n- Common difference (d) = 2 [0.5 Mark]\n\n2. Identification of total terms:\n- Total number of tiers (n) = 8 [1.0 Mark]\n\n3. Formula identification:\n- The formula for the sum of n terms is S\u2099 = n/2 [2a + (n - 1)d] [1.0 Mark]\n\n4. Final Calculation:\n- Substitute values: S\u2088 = 8/2 [2(10) + (8 - 1)2] [0.25 Mark]\n- Simplify: S\u2088 = 4 [20 + 7(2)] [0.25 Mark]\n- Further simplify: S\u2088 = 4 [20 + 14] = 4 [34] [0.25 Mark]\n- Final Answer: S\u2088 = 136 pots [0.25 Mark]",
  "key_idea": "1. These problems are designed to find the total accumulation or sum of a sequence of numbers that increase or decrease by a fixed amount.\n2. The core idea is the Arithmetic Progression (AP) sum formula, which allows us to find the total without adding every single term individually.\n3. This works because an AP is symmetrical; the sum is essentially the average of the terms multiplied by the total number of terms.\n4. General step-by-step method:\n   Step 1: Identify the first term (a), the common difference (d), and the number of terms (n).\n   Step 2: Choose the correct sum formula: S\u2099 = n/2 [2a + (n - 1)d].\n   Step 3: Substitute the known values into the formula.\n   Step 4: Solve the arithmetic inside the brackets before multiplying by the external factor.\n5. Common mistakes include using 'n' instead of 'n/2' outside the brackets or forgetting to multiply 'a' by 2.\n6. To avoid mistakes, always write down the values of a, d, and n clearly before starting the calculation."
